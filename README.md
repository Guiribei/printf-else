# printf-else
My own version of printf at 42sp called ft_printf.

As the intuitive name already suggests, my task here was to reproduce the stdio library's printf function behavior. The main purpose of this project was to introduce the concept of variadic functions. This was a nice project to make. Maybe the first one at 42sp to give me some kind of mental self-reward, I felt amazing while I was coding something that was part of my daily tools.

Although I had used structs in the bonus part of the first project (libft), here on ft_printf I took a closer look on that.
